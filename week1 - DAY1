//Input Output Operations
//Printing an output is very easy in java just we have to write the syntax as:
//System.out.print - for normal printing.
//System.out.println - for Printing the output in next line.
//Code for the output printing

public class Day1{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to CODING BOOTCAMP");
    }
}

//Taking an input from the user is a big task in java.
//First we have to create a scanner class for taking the input and we have to import the library:
//import java.util.Scanner to use the scanner class
//Example code for Input taking and printing 

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Day1 {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Welcome to CODING BOOTCAMP");
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(n);
    }
    
}
